# Ladder app

By *Oto Hlincik*

## Overview

This is a simple app to run a Racquetball Ladder. A ladder is a perpetual competition where each player has a certain rank. The rank is determined by playing **challenge matches** against other players on the ladder. A player can challenge players on the ladder that have higher rank (lower rank number) and are currently above the challenging player on the ladder. If the challenger wins the challenge match, the challenger takes over the rank of the challenged player and the challenged player moves one rank down.

## Basic functionality

At this time, the app allows the racquetball players the following:

* Sign-up to participate in the ladder (creates a user/player account)
* View the Ladder Rankings
* View the current player's Player Profile
* Issue a challenge (...work in progress)
* Submit challenge match results (...work in progress)
